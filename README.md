# Calendar-Cleanup

Looks for events on your calendar in the next 4 weeks that can be safely deleted (ex: 1:1s where your colleague declined or cancelled events) and removes them

At the end sends you an e-mail with a list of events that were removed

By default - the events are not actually being removed, unless you set the input argument "CancelEvents" to true
